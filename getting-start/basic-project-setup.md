# Basic project setup

First, let's create a new folder and name it multiwallet, or whatever you want

```shell-session
mkdir multiwallet
cd multiwallet
```

Let's create a new npm project

```
npm init
```

And install locally locklift. If you have locklift installed globally, skip this step

```
npm install --save-dev locklift
```

Excellent! Now we can create a locklift project

```
npx locklift init
```

We should get such a project structure:
